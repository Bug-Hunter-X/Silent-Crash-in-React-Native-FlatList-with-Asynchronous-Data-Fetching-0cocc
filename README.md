# Silent Crash in React Native FlatList with Asynchronous Data Fetching

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in React Native applications involving FlatLists and asynchronous data fetching.  The application fetches user data from a public API, and when it encounters an error during the fetch, it silently crashes without providing a helpful error message. This makes debugging extremely difficult.  The solution involves implementing robust error handling within the asynchronous operation and providing more informative feedback to the user.

## Bug Description

The `DataFetch.js` component fetches user data using `fetch`. If any error occurs during fetching (e.g., network issue), the app crashes silently. No error is displayed in the console or the app, making it hard to pinpoint the problem.

## Solution

The `DataFetchSolution.js` file provides a solution by incorporating comprehensive error handling using `try...catch` and displaying an error message to the user if data fetching fails.
